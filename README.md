# Lego
React components using Material Design Lite library

![alt tag](http://mackenzie.bc.libraries.coop/files/2014/08/Lego.jpg)

This library is built 100% with ES6. You will need a package manager with ES6 support like `jspm` to make it work.

## Usage
Add this in your main Javascript component:
```javascript
import 'reevoo/lego/lego.css!css';
```

Add this to your html file (icons):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

If you want to try to override the color styling you can try to add this in your html (it might break some stuff):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/code.getmdl.io/1.0.4/material.orange-blue.min.css" />
```
